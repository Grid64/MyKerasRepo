# Keras-for-R

Please click the other .md file to see my code and the output for this project.

This code is some experimenting with keras for R on the very small Boston housing dataset. Deep learning is not really appropriate for such a small dataset, but it's interesting to compare with fitting an ordinary least squares model. I sampled "test data" from all the data. There's a gross outlier in one of the explanatory variables. Model fit depends on whether that observation is selected in the training set or the test set.
